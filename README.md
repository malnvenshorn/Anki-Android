This is a fork of AnkiDroid with some extensions not accepted upstream. Most of the changes try to mitigate some shortcomings of Anki's algorithm. For the original project go to [ankidroid/Anki-Android](https://github.com/ankidroid/Anki-Android).

Special thanks goes to [eshapard](https://eshapard.github.io/) and his thoughts on [improving the Anki algorithm](https://eshapard.github.io/anki/thoughts-on-a-new-algorithm-for-anki.html).

**Additional Features**

* Two button mode (showing only the good and again button)
* Randomized reviews (randomizes learning and review cards when using the v2 scheduler)
* Auto adjust ease factor (automatically modifies the ease factor based on past reviews to target a specific success rate)

**Planned**

* Progress bar of today's cards showing reviewed cards, currently due cards and cards that are due later this day
